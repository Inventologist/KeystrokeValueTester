# KeystrokeValueTester
Keystroke Values for any key you press

This program will tell you what all the relevant info for a ReadKey keystroke is.  The main things like VirtualKeyCode and Character.

Sure, there are tables that you could look this up with, but with all the different keyboards out there, and all the extra/special keys... its just easier to do it this way.

Run the program, choose your option, hit the key, and voila... there are all the attributes you need.

The program is split up in to 2 modes:  RAW and CHAR.  RAW will do what char does, but CHAR mode only gives you a character response if the character is PRINTABLE.  It uses the .Character attribute.  RAW mode will ALSO show you this.

Of the 2 modes, RAW is the most useful.

Enjoy!

PS: I have also included a CSV file of all the characters that you would want to use in a menu system. (including non-printable ones). These were all the keys available/useable on a Microsoft Natural Ergonimic Keyboard 4000 v1.0.
